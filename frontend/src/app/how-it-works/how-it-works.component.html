    <h1>How NoBugs Works</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      A transparent, ethical platform where security researchers and organizations
      collaborate to identify and fix vulnerabilities responsibly.
    </p>
  </header>

  <!-- ================= OVERVIEW ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>Platform Overview</h2>
    <p>
      NoBugs is an educational and practice-focused bug bounty platform designed to
      simulate real-world vulnerability disclosure workflows. It allows organizations
      to publish security testing scopes and enables researchers to report vulnerabilities
      in a controlled, ethical environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The platform emphasizes proper authorization, scope clarity, responsible disclosure,
      and structured communication between all parties involved.
    </p>

  <!-- ================= FOR RESEARCHERS ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>For Security Researchers</h2>

    <h3>1. Browse Programs</h3>
    <p>
      Researchers can explore publicly available programs under the <strong>Programs</strong>
      section. Each program represents an organization that has explicitly defined what
      assets are allowed for testing.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Understand Scope Carefully</h3>
    <p>
      Every scope clearly specifies:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>In-scope assets (domains, APIs, applications)</li>
      <li>Out-of-scope restrictions</li>
      <li>Allowed testing boundaries</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Testing anything outside the declared scope is strictly prohibited.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Perform Ethical Testing</h3>
    <p>
      Researchers are expected to follow responsible security testing practices.
      This includes avoiding data destruction, denial-of-service attacks, and
      any form of unauthorized access.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Submit Bug Reports</h3>
    <p>
      When a vulnerability is discovered, researchers submit a detailed bug report
      including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clear title and description</li>
      <li>Steps to reproduce</li>
      <li>Affected endpoint or asset</li>
      <li>Severity assessment</li>
      <li>Optional supporting evidence</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Track Report Status</h3>
    <p>
      Submitted reports can be tracked from the <strong>My Bug Reports</strong> section.
      Researchers can monitor review progress and updates from the organization.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ================= FOR ORGANIZATIONS ================= -->
  <section>
    <h2>For Organizations</h2>

    <h3>1. Create a Program</h3>
    <p>
      Organizations register and create a single program representing their security
      initiative. Each organization controls its scopes, rules, and review workflow.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Define Clear Scopes</h3>
    <p>
      Scopes are the foundation of safe collaboration. Organizations must clearly define:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Target URLs or assets</li>
      <li>Testing permissions</li>
      <li>Explicit exclusions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Review Bug Reports</h3>
    <p>
      All submitted reports appear in the organization dashboard. Teams can review,
      assess severity, and manage the lifecycle of each report.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Responsible Resolution</h3>
    <p>
      Organizations are encouraged to respond professionally, acknowledge valid reports,
      and resolve issues in a timely manner.
    </p>
